<h1>Texting_Application v:1.0.1</h1>
<p>This is a completed project that can text and email using PHP, with no external libraries, not even jQuery!!<p>
<p>
    Inside the <code>stable</code> folder, you will find 2 files, the <code>texting.html</code> and the <code>texting.php</code>. The <code>texting.html</code> file is the one to go to first, which will then redirect to the <code>texting.php</code> and will result in an endless loop. This is not really set up for production, but it is available online here:<br /><a href="https://hsmscreativitycenter.org/DaMahdi03/Ayman_Studios/Texting_Application/stable/texting.html">https://hsmscreativitycenter.org/DaMahdi03/Ayman_Studios/Texting_Application/stable/texting.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Inside the <code>demo</code> folder, you will also find 2 files, the <code>demo.html</code> and the <code>demo.php</code>. The files are set up in the same way as the previous 2 files. Except, the <code>demo</code> files have a little more funtionality and are a bit more dynamic. <b>You can switch between Email and Phone Number!!</b> This is a bit more prepared for production, and it is available here:<br /><a href="https://hsmscreativitycenter.org/DaMahdi03/Ayman_Studios/Texting_Application/demo/demo.html

</a>.
</p>
<p>I will later add more functionality (Emojis, Voice Recognition, Speech Dictation, Viewing Replies), so stay tuned!!</p>
